# Group Assignment #4: Twitter Analysis

This assignment will focus on a qualitative exploration of your subject of interest. Choose workflow that is relavant to your research inquiry (e.g. following specific user timelines, hashtags, or search terms). Using the twitter analysis techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data. Create at least 3 data visualizations. Each visualization must be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains the plot's interpretation and what you are visualizing and why it is interesting: tell us its story. This story should be accompanied by any relevant descriptive statistics, as needed, to round out the picture.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook).
